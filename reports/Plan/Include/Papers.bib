We establish that the output of the algorithm converges towards the viscosity solution of continuous problem, as the discretization step tends to zero.

This Optimal Control problem can be reformulated as a static Hamilton Jacobi, or Anisotropic Eikonal, Partial Differential Equation, as well as a front propagation model. It has numerous applications, ranging from motion planning to image segmentation. We introduce a new algorithm, Fast Marching using Anisotropic Stencil Refinement (FM-ASR), which addresses this problem on a two dimensional domain discretized on a cartesian grid. The local stencils used in our discretization are produced by arithmetic means. The complexity of the FM-ASR, in an average sense over all grid orientations, only depends (poly-)logarithmically on the anisotropy ratio of the metric, while most alternative approaches have a polynomial dependence. Numerical experiments show, in several occasions, that the accuracy/complexity compromise is improved by an order of magnitude or more.}},

The key ingredient of our PDE numerical scheme is Voronoi's first reduction, a tool from discrete geometry which characterizes the interaction of a quadratic form with an additive lattice. This technique, never used in this context, which is simple and cheap to implement, allows us to efficiently handle Riemannian metrics of eigenvalue ratio \$10\textasciicircum2\$ and more. Two variants of the introduced scheme are also presented, adapted to sub-Riemannian and to Rander metrics, which can be regarded as degenerate Riemannian metrics and as Riemannian metrics perturbed with a drift term, respectively. We establish the convergence of the proposed scheme and of its variants, with convergence rates. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in various contexts, in dimension up to five, including an original sub-Riemannian model related to the penalization of path torsion.}},

abstract = {{<p>A fast marching level set method is presented for monotonically advancing fronts, which leads to an extremely fast scheme for solving the Eikonal equation. Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.</p>}},

In this paper we define and study a class of Multimode Stochastic Shortest Path problems and develop sufficient conditions for the applicability of label-setting methods. We illustrate our approach on a number of discrete stochastic control examples.
