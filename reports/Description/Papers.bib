abstract = {{We introduce numerical schemes for computing distances and shortest paths with respect to several planar paths models, featuring curvature penalization and data-driven velocity: the Dubins car, the Euler/Mumford elastica, and a two variants of the Reeds–Shepp car. For that purpose, we design monotone and causal discretizations of the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman PDEs, posed on the three-dimensional domain R2×S1. Our discretizations involve sparse, adaptive and anisotropic stencils on a cartesian grid, built using techniques from lattice geometry. A convergence proof is provided, in the setting of discontinuous viscosity solutions. The discretized problems are solvable in a single pass using a variant of the fast-marching algorithm. Numerical experiments illustrate the applications of our schemes in motion planning and image segmentation.}},

abstract = {{We address the numerical computation of distance maps with respect to Riemannian metrics of strong anisotropy. For that purpose we solve generalized eikonal equations, discretized using adaptive upwind finite differences on a Cartesian grid, in a single pass over the domain using a variant of the fast-marching algorithm. The key ingredient of our PDE numerical scheme is Voronoi's first reduction, a tool from discrete geometry which characterizes the interaction of a quadratic form with an additive lattice. This technique, never used in this context, which is simple and cheap to implement, allows us to efficiently handle Riemannian metrics of eigenvalue ratio \$10\textasciicircum2\$ and more. Two variants of the introduced scheme are also presented, adapted to sub-Riemannian and to Rander metrics, which can be regarded as degenerate Riemannian metrics and as Riemannian metrics perturbed with a drift term, respectively. We establish the convergence of the proposed scheme and of its variants, with convergence rates. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in various contexts, in dimension up to five, including an original sub-Riemannian model related to the penalization of path torsion.}},

abstract = {{<p>A fast marching level set method is presented for monotonically advancing fronts, which leads to an extremely fast scheme for solving the Eikonal equation. Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.</p>}},
