### Formalization of Fast Marching

To build the Lean files of this project, you need to have a working version of Lean.
See [the installation instructions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html) (under Regular install).

To get this code (for the first time), run `leanproject get fpvandoorn/fast_marching`.
If you already have the repo, you can update it (in the `fast_marching` directory) with `git pull`.

To build the repo, run `leanproject build`. To open files in VSCode, always open the whole project (by running `code .`), instead of opening individual files.
