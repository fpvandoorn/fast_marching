A LINEAR FINITE-DIFFERENCE SCHEME FOR APPROXIMATING RANDERS
DISTANCES ON CARTESIAN GRIDS

It is likely useful to adapt the statements a little bit, to be a bit more flexible about the
type in which we consider these operations, so that the coefficients in `D` and `v` live in the same
type (`ℝ`) for most of the argument. We can still construct a superbase in `ℤ` at the end.
